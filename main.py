    This function iterates through a list of campaigns, performs purchase simulations

    It performs the following steps:
        1. Iterates through a list of YAML files specifying user journeys for each campaign.
        2. For each campaign:
            - Opens the corresponding YAML file and loads the user journeys.
            - Iterates through each user journey within the campaign.
                - Creates a folder to store the results for the current campaign (if it doesn't exist).
                - Creates a filename with a timestamp for the current test.
                - Configures logging to suppress excessive output and save test results to a log file.
                - Logs a message indicating the start of the test for the current campaign.
                - Simulates the purchase process using the `shopper_actions_by_steps` function, handling any exceptions.
                - Logs a message indicating the completion of the test for the current campaign.
                - Updates the timestamp for the current user journey.
                - Saves the test results (including user journeys and timestamps) in a JSON file.
